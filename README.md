## What I Learned

- Use factory functions and module pattern to organize the code into logical chunks.
- Separate the application's operational logic from its display logic. This way, the actual operation logic can become less dependent on DOM elements, thus easier to scale and debug. A concept introduced in [Building A House From The Inside Out](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out).
- Use get and set methods to update or retrieve values in an object instead of directly access an object property because properties are passed by value, which can cause unexpected behavior.
- Gain a better understanding of how event propagation and bubbling works.
- CSS key-frame animation.

## What I can Improve

- Write a flowchart and better pseudocode before the actual coding.
- Get rid of some of the repetitive code by refactoring them into reusable functions or modules.
- Make the AI intelligent.
- Make the website responsive.
